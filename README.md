# Onfinance.ai - project


## Different Approaches 
1. Generate the whole code using Mistral and RAG
2. Break down code into different parts, and right static code yourself + try to generate dynamic code


Try to use OpenSource LLMs as much as possible, would have tried WizardCoder, Mistral, OpenLLama, with React (Reasoning + Action) with Langraph
Interview didn't went that well, coz of Mathematical and in-depth questions - trying to learn in-depth and practicing more
